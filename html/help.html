                        project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit
                        you, and how to use it.

                    <p class="h2_help">What is Join?</p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="lightBlue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built
                        by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer
                        Akademie.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                        limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="lightBlue">Join</span>
                        leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
                        intuitive, visual interface.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is important to note that <span class="lightBlue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
                        exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best
                        possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or

                                    When you log in to <span class="lightBlue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board.
                                    This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In
                                    Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

                                    In <span class="lightBlue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                                    projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
                                    required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                                    interact with the tasks on the board.

                                    Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                    individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new
                                    card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date,
                                    assignees, etc.

                                    As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                    dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
                                </p>

                                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                    Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution
                                    when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.

                                    Remember that using <span class="lightBlue">Join</span> effectively requires
                                    consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current
